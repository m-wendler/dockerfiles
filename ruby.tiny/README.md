# ruby.tiny

A very tiny Ruby setup based on alpine. The complete image is not even 19 MB big ...

Should you not need `bundler` you can kick it out and save another MB.

Run a container from this image like:

`docker run ruby/tiny`

which should display the installed ruby version:

`ruby 2.2.2p95 (2015-04-13 revision 50295) [x86_64-linux-musl]`


Have fun!
